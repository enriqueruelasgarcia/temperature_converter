How it Works
Dynamic Field Validation: The convert button is disabled until all required fields (temperature value, "from" unit, and "to" unit) are filled. The button's appearance changes dynamically based on whether it's active or disabled.

Swap Functionality: Users can swap the "from" and "to" units with a single click, making it more convenient to reverse conversions.

Conversion Logic: When the convert button is clicked, the app calculates the result based on the selected units. A short delay is added for a visual "Converting" effect.
